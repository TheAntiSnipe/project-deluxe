non-godot filenames in snake_case
godot-related names in PascalCase

NEED TO LOOK AT PROPORTIONS

GENERAL MODELS:
	merge all parts that move as one
	final model named in PascalCase
	keep all working-files in project-deluxe-models repo

ITEMS:
	Start with a sphere of fixed diameter (testing at 0.2m, this is what will rotate up and down)
	Keep origin of item at center of sphere (and at world center)
	Free to decorate sphere
	
SHIP STYLE GUIDE:
	Every ship given its own turret, rather than every item (look at after some time)
	Size:
		Length: ~1.3m
		Width: ~0.7m (in relation to length of 1.3)

	Turret:
		Turret base saved as separate model
		Turret base highest point on model
		add empty for TurretBasePosition
			add empty for ItemPosition
		Turrets responsible for horizontal rotation (note to self - turret would be everything that rotates, including the socket)

TEXTURE:
	Aplha maps need to be combined with colour into RGBa
