godot-related names in PascalCase

NEED TO LOOK AT PROPORTIONS

GENERAL MODELS:
	merge all parts that move as one
	final model named in PascalCase
	keep all working-files in project-deluxe-models repo

ITEMS:
	Start with a sphere of fixed diameter (testing at 0.2m, this is what will rotate up and down)
	Keep origin of item at center of sphere (and at world center)
	Free to decorate sphere
	
SHIP STYLE GUIDE:
	Every ship given its own turret, rather than every item (look at after some time)
	Size:
		Length: ~1.3m
		Width: ~0.7m (in relation to length of 1.3)

	Turret:
		20 Side Cylinder, scaled to 0.25

		Turret base saved as separate model
		Turret base highest point on model
		add empty for TurretBasePosition
			add empty for ItemPosition
		Turrets responsible for horizontal rotation (note to self - turret would be everything that rotates, including the socket)

TEXTURE:
	Alpha maps need to be combined with colour into RGBa

	Smart Material:
		duplicate the MASK layer for each different material
		
		Use BASE to achieve desired roughness and metallic
		GRADIENT layer should be a more saturated version of base
		EDGES can bring up roughness, also a good idea to made it complementary colour of base
